      <h1>Info About Competition</h1>
      <h2 class="yoyoR">Yo-Yo Rules</h2>
      <p class="rules">
        There are no special restrictions on the maker, type, parts or modifications used for the freestyle yo-yo.
        Safety is still a prime concern, so any modifications that compromise the safety of the contestant, venue, or audience may result in disqualification.
        Strings used must be string for the exclusive use of yo-yoing. In the case of styles that require special string, (Go West, Long String, Transparent String, etc.),
        it may be used only with the prior consultation, safety confirmation, and permission from judges
        A contestant may only use the yo-yos they personally bring with them on stage. During their freestyle, a contestant may not receive or use yo-yos from audience members.
        In divisions including (but not limited to) 4A and 5A, if a yo-yo falls off the stage, it may no longer be used. Even if a yo-yo is returned to the stage by an audience member with good
        intent it may not be used. In the case that a contestant uses that yo-yo, positive points will not be scored during its use and negative points will continue to be subject for deduction.
        Contestants are required to use their yo-yo(s) as a yo-yo.
        In the case that a contestant performs in a style that is not subject to their division, that part of the performance will not be scored
        (however, negative points may still be applied). For example, if off string elements are used in any other division than 4A they will not receive points.
        Due to the yo-yo tangle or yo-yo change (discard) you can use more total yo-yos than allowed below.
      </p>

      <p class="set">
      Below is a list of the number of yo-yos that can be used simultaneously during freestyles for each division:
      </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>1A – 1 yo-yo</li>
      <li>2A – 2 yo-yos</li>
      <li>3A – 2 yo-yos</li>
      <li>4A – 1 or more yo-yos</li>
      <li>5A – 1 or more yo-yos</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="rules2">
      In the case that yo-yos exceeding the permitted number are used (or held) simultaneously, all tricks subject to positive scoring and positive evaluation will not be counted.
      Non Yo-Yo Items
      The contestant is only allowed to bring yo-yos, strings, counter-weights, gloves (or equivalent items),
      a backup music CD for competition, and a tray provided by contest officials onto the stage. Maintenance tools, performance props, and any other items are strictly prohibited.
      This includes (but is not limited to) items such as bags, cases, cloth, jackets, extra clothing (other than what the contestant is already wearing), and tables.
      Contestants bringing prohibited items to the stage are subject to disqualification. However, for the purpose of protecting valuables (such as a bag, wallet, cellular phone, etc.),
      a contestant may leave their belongings at the side of the stage, but is prohibited from interacting with them.
